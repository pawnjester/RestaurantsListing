## Architecture
- This app uses [MVVM (Model View View-Model)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#recommended-app-arch) architecture, repository pattern and clean architecture.
- In line with the clean architechure, this project is divided into different modules:
    -- App (This is the main entry of the application)
    -- Cache (This module handles everything concerning the Room database)
    -- Core ( This is an abstraction of the essentials of the app)
    -- Data (This includes the domain layer. It implements the interface exposed by the domain layer and dispenses data to the app.
    -- Domain (This contains the business Logic of the Application)
    -- Provider (This provides an abstraction for the data source i.e. Json File)
    -- Restaurants (This is main UI layer)

## How to make use of the app
- Clone this repo.
- This app requires a minimum sdk of 24

## How to run test
-> For unit Tests, you can either run a project wide test using `./gradlew test` or go to the `App`, `Cache` and `Restaurants` Modules to run them individually.
-> For Instrumentation/UI test, you can also run `./gradlew connectedAndroidTest` or locate the `RestuarantActivityTest.kt` file in the androidTest directory in the restaurant module
